# Birthday Tracker
## Description
Duration: 1 Week Sprint

For this one week sprint, I built the Birthday Tracker app. This app is meant for people like me who are terrible at remembering when people's birthdays are. Users can have the names and birthdays of their close friends and family members all in one easy to access place, and never forget a birthday again. All information entered is stored locally in each user's browser. 

In the future, I would like to add authentication so that users can create a username and password. Once authentication is added, I will add a database to store each user's info so that they can access it on multiple devices. Lastly, I would like to add push-notifications to remind users when one of the saved birthdays is a week away.
